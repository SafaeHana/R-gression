# Regression
## Objective:
The main objective of this workshop is to practice the two concepts of regression: simple linear regression and multiple linear regression, by dealing with data from several Data Sets.

## Tools:
Python, Pandas, Sklearn, Matplotlib.

## Data Sets:
Experience and Salary: https://www.kaggle.com/rohankayan/years-of-experience-and-salarydataset
Insurance: https://www.kaggle.com/sinaasappel/tutorial-multiple-regression/data
China GDP: https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/ ML0101ENv3/labs/china_gdp.csv
## Part 1 (Data Visualization):
Using Pandas, explore the data from the two Data Sets.
Display the statistical summary of the two Data Sets with an interpretation of the obtained results.
Display the scatter plot of the first data set "Experience/Salary" using Matplotlib and Pandas.
Display the scatter plots of the second data set according to the "Features" properties using Matplotlib and Pandas "scatter_matrix".
## Part 2 "Simple Regression: Experience-Salary Case":
In this part, we will use the Experience-Salary Data Set.

Using the sklearn API, train the model using the linear regression algorithm.
Predict the data from a test data set.
Visualize the result of the regression in the form of a graph.
Evaluate the model using these three methods:
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Interpret the evaluation results.

## Part 3 "Multiple Regression: Insurance Case":
In this part, we will use the Insurance Data Set.

Using the sklearn API, train the model using the linear regression algorithm.
Predict the data from a test data set.
Visualize the result of the regression in the form of a graph.
Evaluate the model using these three methods:
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Interpret the evaluation results.

## Part 4 "Multiple Polynomial Regression: China GDP Case":
Using the sklearn API, train the model using the linear regression algorithm and then the polynomial linear regression.
Predict the data from a test data set for both models.
Visualize the result of the regression in the form of a graph for both models.
Evaluate the two models using these three methods:
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Interpret the evaluation results.
